                                BookiePro charges a Commission on any net winnings in a particular market. So if,
                                for example, you have net winnings of
                                10 BitFun in the Moneyline market on the England @ Germany game, Commission will be
                                charged on
                                that 10 BitFun. BookiePro's Commission rate is 1%. We talk about "net winnings"
                                because
                                users can have multiple bets (back and lay) in a single market - it is the net profit
                                across
                                all those bets that is liable to have Commission paid on it. If a user makes a net loss
                                in
                                a market (or zero profit, neither plus nor minus) then no Commission is due. Commission
                                fees
                                are calculated and deducted from net winnings after the event is finished.

                                No, not if that was your only bet in this market. Commission is only paid by users who

                                If you had a second bet in that market that won more than your first bet, then you
                                would pay
                                Commission, on your net winnings (net winnings = winnings - losses).

                            <p>Yes. Firstly, the Betslip can shift focus when tabbing so that bet details become
                                obscured for the user. Simply leave the page to clear this bug. Secondly, exporting a
                                list of your transactions to spreadsheet has a formatting bug. Lastly, there is a
                                recognized bug where the BookiePro app, when idle for some time, occasionally drops its
                                connection to the blockchain without 'realizing'. In this case, any bets or
                                transactions you submit will not display in the app. To fix this issue, please close
                                the app then open and log in again.
                                This issue will be addressed in the next version of the app. These bugs will be fixed
                                in the next release.</p>
